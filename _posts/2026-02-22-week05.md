## Video Reflections

### Craig McLuckie: Managing Supply Chain Risk in a World of AI Assisted Developers

This was my favorite of the three. It really caught my attention because I use AI-assisted coding tools every day. The idea that AI doesn't just help developers but also empowers bad actors is something I hadn't fully thought through. If AI can help me write code faster, it can also help someone generate and publish malicious packages at scale. That's genuinely scary.

His suggestions around establishing provenance with tools like Sigstore and SBOMs make a lot of sense. We need to be able to trace where code comes from, especially as AI-generated code becomes more common.

### Kelsey Hightower: Thoughts on Open Source

Hightower's talk was really memorable. He compared this hidden craftsman who quietly perfects your clothing to the silent open-source maintainers who patch and fix software behind the scenes.

The *confd* and HashiCorp story was a great example of what the spirit of open source really looks like. Most people would be upset if someone forked their project and grows bigger, but Hightower was thrilled because that's exactly how open source is supposed to work. It's a good reminder that ownership in open source is different from ownership in the proprietary world. It's important to recognize and be recognized for your open-source work, but you also have to keep reminding yourself why you're doing it. The spirit of open source is about sharing and collaboration, not building walls around your code.

### Linus Torvalds in Conversation with Dirk Hohndel

Torvalds has this blunt, no-nonsense style that makes everything feel honest. His take on the kernel being "calm, steady, and boring" after 30 years is actually kind of aspirational. That's what a well-maintained project looks like at maturity.

His thoughts on AI were refreshingly grounded. While everyone else is panicking or hyping, Torvalds just calls it "auto-correct on steroids." I tend to agree. AI tools are incredibly useful for finding bugs and speeding up mundane tasks, but they're not replacing human judgment anytime soon.

## Group Presentations

This week we presented QuickHistory to the class. It didn't go as smoothly as I'd hoped. What happened was that during the first part of the demo, we deleted some browsing history to show off that feature. But we didn't think ahead, because the history we deleted was exactly what we planned to search for in the next part of the demo. So when we tried to ask the AI agent to find those pages, there was nothing to find. Kind of embarrassing, but also kind of funny in hindsight. On top of that, we didn't rehearse who was going to say what, so there were a few awkward moments where we were figuring out on the fly who should talk next. Lesson learned: always do a dry run, and think through the demo flow end to end so you don't sabotage your own demo.

Watching other groups present was genuinely interesting. Most teams looked confident and did a great job with their demos. Seeing what other people built with their extensions gave me a broader perspective on what's possible with the Chrome extension platform.

## Presentation Style Observations

Between the student presentations and the OSS conference keynotes, I got to see a wide range of presentation styles this week. The conference speakers were on another level, but not because of fancy slides or production value. It was because they told stories.

Kelsey Hightower opened with a story about a tailor fixing his sports coat. Linus Torvalds cracked jokes about hoping he never has another big project. Craig McLuckie walked through the XZ vulnerability like a detective story. These speakers made technical topics engaging by weaving in personal experiences and narrative arcs.

The student presentations, including ours, were more straightforward. Here's what we built, here's how it works, here's a demo. That's fine, but it can get monotonous. One thing I want to improve in my own presentation style is incorporating more narrative. Instead of jumping straight into "here's the feature," I could start with "here's the problem we were frustrated by" and let the demo feel like the payoff to a story. It's a small shift, but it makes a big difference in keeping the audience engaged and not bored.
