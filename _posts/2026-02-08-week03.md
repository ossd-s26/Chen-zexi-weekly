title: Week 3 - Open Source Project QuickHistory
---

## Project Overview

Our group project is called **QuickHistory**. We came up with this project because managing browser history sucks. Chrome's built-in history page is basically just a long list you have to scroll through. We're building a Chrome extension that makes it easy and effortless to manage your history using AI.

QuickHistory uses LangChain and OpenAI to let you interact with your browsing history through natural language. You can ask in natural language to find the website you visited but can't recall the name of. But it's not just read-only, the agent can actually perform actions on your behalf. You can also delete history based on your criteria by simply saying something like "delete all my YouTube history".

## Contributions
Our team has been working well together so far. I've been handling the LangChain and AI side — setting up the agent and bridging it with the Chrome API. The collaboration has been smooth, with a pretty clear division of work. It's been really fun to work together as a team solving a shared pain point.

## Progress
Currently, we already have prove of concept of AI features working. We will collaborate more next week to piece everything together.
