Hi, I'm Alan Chen, a CS and DS student at NYU. I'm into building AI agents harness and infrastructure that make it easier to work with large language models.

Here are some of my open source projects I have worked on:

- [**open-ptc-agent**](https://github.com/Chen-zexi/open-ptc-agent) — open source implementation of programmatic tool calling for AI agents, with sandboxed code execution and MCP server support
- [**vllm-cli**](https://github.com/Chen-zexi/vllm-cli) — CLI tool for serving LLMs with vLLM, with config profiles, monitoring, and multi-GPU support
- [**hf-model-tool**](https://github.com/Chen-zexi/hf-model-tool) — CLI for organizing and managing locally downloaded AI models and datasets
